# Description: This is a script to import human subject data from a set of Microsoft Excel files from the Efficient Strategy Selection Microworld Experiment. The script then parses the data into forms suitable for plotting and analyses.


# Analyze data from the Efficient Strategy Selection (ESS) behavioral study


# Note: to adhere to the sum-to-zero convention for effect weights, you should always do this before running anovas in R:

options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))

# Put the code right at the top of your script, run it each time you start a new R session.
# Of course, if you have some principled reason why you do not want to adhere to the sum-to-zero convention for effects weights, then by all means, use some other convention. The important thing to remember is that R, by default, does NOT adhere to the sum-to-zero convention, so if you fail to use the above code snippet, your results may not look like what you get in SPSS or in common texts on ANOVA.

# My error term DFs seem to differ between R & SPSS. It's apparently because SPSS is excluding cases with missing values while Anova {car} {R} is not. What are the consequences to including those values, aside from increased power relative to excluding them? I might have an issue because those NaNs might've been transmuted to strings during the repeated measures parsing process! Meanwhile I've learned that R does exclude NaNs (by default) and that I need to try these analyses again with 3 bins anyway. So use that to figure out how to parse numeric data into numeric vectors, not character vectors.
